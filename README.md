# whatsapp QR relay

just after whatsapp disabled a service for companies to use a third party whatsapp service,
I created this to relay the QR code for the webui.

Why? Employee A is in location X with the phone.
Employee B takes over the customer support service in location Y.
B isn't able to login via whatsapp webui.

This code fixes this issue.
Used in the second half of 2016,
don't know, don't care if it still works.

## TLS
Since whatsapp has a script policy
your webserver needs TLS.
In the examples you can see we the domain `huil.bid`.
